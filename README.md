# Simple Clang C++ project for Win32

## Description

A simple project template for a Win32 executable and library built using Clang-CL with CMake and VCPkg.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to have a somewhat minimal project containing various parts I commonly have in my projects such that I can clone this repo, make a few monifications and have a new application or library started quickly.
